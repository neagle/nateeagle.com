/* Module Rules */
/* As briefly mentioned in the previous section, a Module is a more discrete
 * component of the page. It is your navigation bars and your carousels and
 * your dialogs and your widgets and so on. This is the meat of the page.
 * Modules sit inside Layout components. Modules can sometimes sit within other
 * Modules, too. Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone
 * component. In doing so, the page will be more flexible. If done right,
 * Modules can easily be moved to different parts of the layout without
 * breaking.
