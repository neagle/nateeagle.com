;B[oq]C[This is (I believe) an opening associated with Hashimoto Utaro. It's often called the orthodox opening on KGS (and Sensei's Library, apparently: http://senseis.xmp.net/?OrthodoxFuseki), though Shifu seemed surprised to hear it called that.

I use to play alternating komoku a lot, but I've been shifting my game away from being so territory-oriented.]
;W[qj]
;B[ce]
;W[ed]LB[jc:B][cd:A]TR[dp]C[Shifu said that this wasn't as good a choice for white, because of the marked stone. The Shusaku diagonal is a defensive response, one that gives white such strength in the corner that it's perfectly acceptable for white to tenuki after this because of miai at A and B. Instead, white should pincer.

I was happy to see this move played because, as a Hikaru no Go fan, I have a personal fondness for Shusaku's diagonal. And, of course, the follow-up to this is comfortable, too.]
;B[ci]LB[ee:A]C[Black can extend three spaces intead of two because A is sente.]
;W[nc]C[This seemed like overreach to me, but Shifu said this was appropriate for white, given the lost opportunity of choosing the diagonal rather than the pincer.]
;B[qf]C[This is sente. White needs to take care of his stone on the right.]
;W[qm]
;B[lc]LB[hc:A][ic:B]C[But this is the wrong way for black to punish. A move at A or B would do a better job of ruining the top.]
;W[jc]C[This is ideal for white. This is the move missing from the joseki for white earlier.]
;B[md]C[And this is very awkward for black, because the corner's still open.

Even at the time, I felt unsatisfied with this move.]

;B[rf]
;W[rd]LB[pe:A]C[White ends in gote.

Nathan said he likes this pattern because he'll frequently be able to use the aji of the cut at A. Shifu described Nathan as having "Rambo style" - any cut, anything that doesn't have two eyes, is a target!]
;B[cn]LB[qd:A]C[This is a big move for black to get, and it's made possible by the mistake at A. I felt the game was going well for me at this point.]
(;W[ck]C[Now white gets aggressive. But given that white needs to do some catching up, it's not a terrible idea to try to complicate things.]
;B[en]C[The jump is natural.]
;W[fq]
;B[dj]C[This is too easy for black.]
;W[cg]C[So white invades again! This is obviously not good for white, but, on the other hand, the pressure is on black to prove this with correct play.]
;B[ee]C[This move made white think for a long time. I wish I could take credit for seeing it on my own: shifu showed it to me in a lesson review after a game I played with Ben where I fell apart in this joseki.]
;W[dh]C[But white didn't answer! So I had to try to come up with the correct follow-up on my own.]

(;B[bi]
;W[bf]
;B[ah]
;W[be]C[This is an excellent result for white, who kills the three vital black stones, securing both a big corner and thickness toward the center.]
;B[je]C[This cap was correct for black, threatening white on the top and connecting to the three stones now pressed against a white fortress.]
;W[kd]C[This was wrong for white. I was very happy when white played this: it helped me get stronger and was very easy to play. No tough decisions.]
;B[lf]
;W[ke]
;B[kf]
;W[jf]
;B[ie]
;W[jg]C[Great for black.]
;B[hg]LB[hc:A]C[This was wrong, though, according to Shifu. Though it's hard enough for me to see what's correct that I'm forgetting what he suggested as an alternative.  The alternative must've been to cut off white on the top instead, maybe around A?

At the time, I thought I was securing access to the center and keeping the pressure on white's two stones in the middle.]

;B[pe]
;W[of]
;B[od]
;W[oa]
;B[og]C[White was surprised by this move. I'll confess to feeling a measure of satisfaction when playing it in the game. Black wins the capturing race by one liberty, now.]

(;B[qr]C[This was slow. I wasn't sure he best way to secure the corner in this situation, and I didn't want to take unnecessary risks in a game in which I was ahead.]
;W[bp]
;B[pn]C[Here, black can't cut white and stay connected.

At the time, I thought it was worth it to get cut off if I also cut off white. I'm sure Shifu would make a disappointed sound if he heard me say that. "You are winning!" he would say. "Part of go skill is to control the game, not give your opponent chances!"]

;W[km]
;B[oj]C[This is good for black. It threatens white on the right side and connects to his own help.]
;W[jp]C[This is the right idea for white: he has to try. But black needs to make a mistake.]
;B[kp]
;W[lr]
;B[in]C[Correct. Get access to the center.]
;W[gm]
;B[il]C[Also correct.]
;W[el]LB[dk:A]C[Giving up these two stones is fine, because it's not that big (black has a push and cut starting at A), and black has more than adequate compensation.]
(;B[kr]C[Here I start to attack white's group, which is not yet alive.]
;W[on]
;B[pm]
;W[nm]C[White's trying to make eyes, but it's also damaging the right.

For black, it's hard not to enjoy a game like this, where every way your opponent struggles seems to bring you good things.]

(;B[ic]C[I saw this continuation, but thought I should just leave it. For one thing, I thought white was already cut off, but that's wrong - white can force the capturing race and connect underneath, at least.
