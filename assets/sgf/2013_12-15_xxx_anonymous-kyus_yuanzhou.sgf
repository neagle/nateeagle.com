C[White 4 on the 3-5 point aims to either discourage Black from making the corner enclosure at A by playing a strong stone a line closer to that corner or else to enable White to counter with a corner enclosure at B if Black plays at A.]
;B[cq]
C[Black chooses to fight with the active response of invading at the 3-3 point. Black 5 could also be at A or B. (It turns out that neither player is very familiar with the joseki possibilities in this situation.) The common result of the game play or Black A is that Black lives in the corner and White takes the outside. In this game, the result is a long, complicated fight.]
LB[cp:A][do:B];W[do]
C[White 6 is a correct response.]
(;B[ep]
C[Black chooses to cut White to start fighting. Note that the potential ladder after White A would be good for Black. This has an important impact on the joseki possibilities. However, Black 7 is a little bit of an overplay though not a very big mistake. Given that Black does not know the josekis, this is not bad. See the variations for the normal joseki.]
LB[dp:A];W[dp];B[dq]
C[Black 9 is a must.];W[fq]
C[Since the ladder is good for Black, White must extend at 10. This is not bad for White since  Black's corner is not alive at this point.]
;B[eo]
C[Black 11 is very aggressive, an overplay. Because the corner is not alive, the honte play (that is, in accord with traditional theory) for Black is at A. However, White would then capture the marked black stone at B and get outside thickness, which would be good for White.]
LB[bo:A][fo:B]TR[ep];W[bp]
C[White 12 is the correct move now, preventing a black slide up the side.]
;B[bq]
C[Black must block with 13.];W[cp]
C[White must connect with 14.];B[er]
C[Black must continue with 15 since the corner is not alive.];W[fr]
(;B[ds]
C[Black 17 is a mistake. This is the "large pig's mouth" shape and is dead (if you know your life and death tactics). See the variation for White's next move. (This is a dan level life and death problem. Can you see how to kill this corner? See the variation for White's next move.) Black 17 at A is also a dead shape. Black can live in ko by playing 17 at B. See the variation for Black 17.]

C[(Neither player is familiar with the large pig's mouth shape.)];B[bs]
C[After 19, Black is fully alive. This is good for Black, of course.];W[cr]
C[20 is a small loss for White. Black is alive.];B[br];W[gp]LB[en:A]
C[White 22 is wrong. White must hane at A first, then help the bottom white group. That would make the situation good for White.]
;B[en]
C[After 23, the situation is good for Black. White is weak.];W[cm];B[hn]
C[25 is a good move for Black. White cannot try to set up a cut at A because Black B would be sente. Then Black C would protect the cutting point.]

C[White must protect with 38 or lose this group.]

C[The variation for Black 39 is better than the game move, but this is not bad.]
(;W[bn]
C[White 40 is not good. See the variation.];B[dn]
C[After Black 41 shortens White's liberties, the situation is again good for Black.]
;W[bl];B[bo];W[dj]LB[ao:A][co:B][ck:C]
C[White should play atari at A with 44, forcing Black B, to reduce Black's gains here (as opposed to what happens later). 44 also leaves some aji around C.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[dl]LB[ek:A]
C[Black 47 is bad. Black should push at A.];W[cl];B[fk]LB[ek:A]
C[Black 49 should be at A.];W[gl];B[gk]LB[hm:A][an:B]
C[Black 51 is also not good. Connecting at A is much more powerful. Playing 51 at B is even better. The game play helps White.]
;W[hl];B[cj]
C[Black 53 is suicide.];W[ci];B[an];W[am]LB[bk:A]
C[White 56 is bad; White A captures two stones.];B[bm]
C[Black is happy to take the ko first.];W[qq]
C[White 58 is a loss. 58 should be at A (without setting up the ko).]LB[oq:A]
;B[pq];W[bn];B[ao];W[nq]LB[ip:A]
C[White should capture at A with 62 to settle this group. White fails to see the danger of Black A.]
(;B[kq]LB[qr:A][oq:B]
C[Black should play atari at A first and then connect at B. This is a much better result for Black. 63 is a mistake. See the variation.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[po]
C[White gains with 66. This result is much better for White than variation More for Black.]
;B[oq]LB[oo:A][np:B]
C[Black 67 is wrong because A is sente for White. Black has to turn at B with 67, allowing White to turn at 67. This is a local loss for Black but can't be helped.]
;W[qr]
C[White 68 is a good move.];B[qo]LB[oo:A]
C[Black 69 is a mistake---White A is sente.];W[qn];B[rn];W[oo];B[np]LB[ip:A]
C[Black should pull out at A with 73.];W[rm]
C[White 74 is correct. White has gained a lot here.];B[mn]
C[Black 75 is good.];W[rp]
C[White doesn't see the problem yet.];B[ip];W[jp];B[iq];W[jq]
(;B[ir]LB[jo:A]
C[Black 81 is a big mistake. Black should cut at A first and then descend at 81. See the variation. If White connects at A now the loss will not be that bad for White.]
;W[jr]
C[White 82 reflects misreading. It does not help.];B[hr]LB[jo:A]
C[Black could still cut at A with 83. This is a big oversight.];W[gr];B[fp]
;W[is];B[gq];W[ko]
C[Fixing this cut gets White back into the game, although it would be better to just connect solidly. The game play leaves too much aji here.]
;B[mq]
C[Black 89 is a good defense.

At this point Black is still a little better in the game, although White's gains in the lower right have made the game closer.]
;W[hk]LB[nc:A][in:B]
C[White should take a big move such as A with 90. If White is worried about the aji in the lower center, White 90 should be at B.]
;B[fi]
C[Black 91 is a slow move, allowing White to gain ground in the game.];W[di]
C[White 92 is sente.];B[ek]
C[Black has to connect. It is obvious now that the marked black stone is poorly placed.]
TR[fi];W[nc]
C[94 is a big gain for White.];B[qf];W[fh]
C[White 96 is not a good move. It does not protect the upper left side. 96 should be at A. That would give White a solid block of territory.]

C[Black 97 is good.];W[fd];B[cc]
C[Black 99 is correct in this situation.];W[cb];B[bc]LB[cd:A][bb:B][cg:C]
C[Black should draw back at A with 101. Then White B, Black C, and White cannot kill this black group.]

C[Black 103 is a mistake. See the variation.];W[cf]
C[White 104 is the correct response.];B[ce];W[bd]LB[bg:A]

C[White should slide to A with 118.];B[pb]
C[After saving the big corner with 119, Black is good in the game.];W[mb]
C[White 120 prevents a black connection here, which White needs to do.];B[lb]
C[Black 121 is correct, preventing White from jumping in. Black is still good.]
;W[qh]
C[White 122 is an overplay, but White needs to stretch for the best possible result.]
;B[ml]
C[Black 123 is good, preventing a white cap here to build up center potential.]

C[White 124 prevents Black from pulling out from the left.];B[nr]
C[Capturing with Black 125 is a nice clean way to deal with this situation.]

C[Honte for White 126 is at A. White is trying to get territory but the area is open.]

C[Black 127 should be a peep at A though the game play is still a headache for White. See the variation.]
;W[pg]
C[After 128, White is connected.];B[nj];W[nk]LB[qj:A]
C[White 130 is another overplay. White should just defend at A. White would be a little ahead in the game after 130 at A.]

FG[4353:Black Gets a Ko]PM[1]MN[1]
C[This is best play for both sides. Black gets a ko which is not bad in this situation. White takes the ko and there is no ko threat at this stage so Black connects at 9. White must fill at 7 with 10 to kill (otherwise Black A wins). This gives Black's dead corner group a huge number of liberties. So Black can start a fight by extending to B on the outside to create a liberty battle/capturing race on one side or the other and White would have a problem. White must get both white groups out, which will not be easy. After White C, Black will play D, White E, Black F, etc. The conclusion is that if Black descends to 1 with 17 in the game, White should just play on the outside at B and let the situation in the corner wait until White fixes the outside situation.]

C[The cut with Black 3 is the critical move. This is the way for Black to avoid being solidly sealed into the corner. If White cannot capture either Black 1 or 3, then Black succeeds in separating White and Black is fine. In this situation, White cannot capture 3. After White 4 White cannot capture Black 1 and 5 so White must stand up with 6. Then Black must protect on the inside with 7 and White attacks 3. However, in this case this ladder is good for Black so White cannot play this way. See variation Normal Joseki 2.]

FG[4353:Normal Joseki 2]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Because the ladder is good for Black, White must connect with 6. After Black turns with 7, White must protect with 8. Now Black must protect against a white clamp at A so Black 9, which is sente. White must protect with 10 and Black pulls out with 11. White protects and threatens with 12 and Black jumps out with 13. White 14 is sente against the corner; Black must protect at 15, which makes the corner alive. White then gets out at the bottom with 16. Black has sente and could attack on the left side or at the bottom or play in the center. This result is a reasonable fighting situation and the best both players can do in this situation. See the varition for White 2 in this sequence for another possibility. This is why Black's invasion at the 3-3 point in the game is a good idea.]
