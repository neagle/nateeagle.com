I went over this game with my shifu (teacher), Yuan Zhou, who is based out of Germantown, MD. (http://zhouyuan.com/) In an attempt to gain greater benefit from his comments and, perhaps, to entertain you, I've recorded some of his comments on the game here.

All of Yuan Zhou's comments are in quotation marks and have, of course, been filtered through me, so some alteration of voice is inevitable. Yuan Zhou will be referred to as "shifu" for the remainder of this record.]RE[W+Resign]

"It's not a shape to be proud of. It's not a good shape. Sometimes it comes up in even games, too. There are severe invasions at A and B. C and D are severe attacks, depending on the direction black wants. E, F, G, and H are all possibilities, too, depending on the situation."

But is this good handicap strategy?

"It does leave the area open, with a lot of variations. It's not easy to see the best thing to do or the best way to do it. You can play this way against kyu players. I've played this way up to... 3 dan. But after that, they'll deal with it too well."]

I wanted to attack the marked group rather than just respond to black.

"At the top, white is strong. If you kill black more, that's just more points. If black can attack on the bottom, black can help his corner and threaten white's safety. So there's more value there than just points.

"Also, black's marked group is in a very awkward position. It's kind of a headache what to do with it. If black wants to save it, it has to run, right? There's no room for eye space. So while black is running, white will destroy black's potential on the center and the right. That's why black chose not to run.

"If white offers to exchange something for that group, that's good for black. It's a way for black to throw away the burden.

"Moreover: let's say the point values of this exchange are the same." (Which is not actually the case - the value at bottom is bigger, as shifu demonstrated.) "If you have even possibilities, you pick the one where you're weak. That is always the case."]
