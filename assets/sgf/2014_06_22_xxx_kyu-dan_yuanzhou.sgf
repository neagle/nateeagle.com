;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[oc]
C[So far this is fine. Black is playing in a solidly territorial way. Black 5 is a patient way to play, maintaining the benefit of initial sente.]
;W[qn]
C[White 6 is a normal play nowadays. White does not play a one space high or low approach because a black pincer then would be too severe. Black can still pincer, of course, but White has more room to maneuver.]
;B[qp]
C[This solid response with Black 6 is fine, not slow.];W[qk]
C[White 8 is normal, making a solid position. Black gets sente.];B[co]
C[Black 9 is the correct continuation. The left side is the biggest area and the 3-4 stone corner is more important for Black to restrict since White can close it with one more move.]
;W[dl]
C[White 10 is a reasonable pincer. Black's common response for a defensive aim would be at A. If Black wants to jump out, it should be at B. Since White 10 is two spaces away, Black should jump two spaces, not one. This is a normal play---when the opponent's stone is two spaces or more away you should jump two spaces since there is less danger of being cut. Against a one space pincer you can only jump one space. Black could also respond to the pincer at C, although Black C can lead to a push and cut by White which is not so good in a situation where there are more white stones around. However, if Black is approaching a 4-4 stone and White plays a two space pincer, Black should jump only one space since a slide into the corner would be a good play.]
LB[dn:A][fo:B][ep:C];B[eo]
C[Black 11 is a slow move and leaves a good response for White, but it is not a big mistake, actually an old joseki move.]
;W[fp]
C[White 12 is correct.]
(;B[bq]
C[Trying to settle is the right idea for Black, but this move is not sente. Also, note that it is much smaller than the slide into the corner that has a 4-4 stone. Black is obviously looking at playing at A, so White should now block at B to prevent that. It would be much better for Black to play 13 at C if Black is going to continue in the corner since that would be sente. See the variation for Black 13.]
LB[bl:A][cn:B][cq:C]
(;W[cr]
C[White 14 is a slow move. White should play at A as in the variation "Better for White".]
LB[cn:A];B[bl]
C[Now Black is good. White's corner is smaller than it would be in a similar 4-4 point stone joseki.]
(;W[cl]
C[White 16 is not the normal play in this situation. See the variation "Normal Cut".]
;B[bk]
C[Black 17 is a very good move.];W[bm]
C[White 18 gains White nothing.];B[bn]
C[Black can connect.];W[bo]
C[White 20 is another mistake. White should peep at A, although Black can then cut at B. White suffers from some bad moves here.]
LB[dn:A][cm:B];B[cm]
C[Black 21 is correct. White has wasted a move here.];W[cp]
C[Given the situation, White 22 is the best White can do.]
(;B[bp]
C[Black 23 is fine and rather big, although Black could consider fighting back on the outside by playing 23 at A. See the variation "Fighting Back".]
LB[dp:A];W[do]
C[White has this atari but it is not a big deal for Black.]
(;B[ao]
C[Taking the white stone is okay, but connecting would be better. The game move leaves White a sente forcing move at A. See the variation.]
LB[dm:A];W[dm];B[dn]
C[Black 27 is good. Black should not connect and allow White to play at 27. White cannot now capture the marked stone since Black can capture below and do serious damage to White's corner group.]
TR[cm];W[dp]
C[White must connect with 28.];B[cn]
C[This sequence has worked out okay for Black.];W[en]
C[White 30 is a good move, but White's shape is broken so overall it is still good for Black.]
(;B[em]LB[fo:A]
C[It would be better for Black to pull out at A with 31. See the variation.]
;W[fn];B[fo]
C[Black 33 is not good. White should just kill these two stones at A. Black 33 should be at B to capture the three white stones above.]
LB[go:A][fm:B];W[dj]
C[White 34 is a mistake. White should not try to save these three stones that are attached to a live black group. This makes the marked black stone very useful.]
TR[bk];B[go]
C[Black 35 is correct. This situation is very good for Black.];W[gm]
C[White must run with 36. The situation is very bad for White.];B[gp];W[gq]
C[White 38 is overly aggressive.];B[hq];W[hr]
C[White 40 continues very aggressively. However, given White's desperate situation, this is probably the best way for White to play. There is no good move for White here. White must seek complications, hoping for an opportunity to get back in the game.]
(;B[ir]
C[Black 41 should cut at A. See the variation.]LB[gr:A];W[hp];B[iq];W[fr]
;B[io]
C[Overall, Black is still fine.];W[jc]LB[el:A]
C[White A would be the right move for 46 if White were not behind.];B[cc]
C[Black 47 is good enough for Black at this point.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be]
;W[bf]LB[cf:A]
C[Extending at A with 52 would make things easy for Black, so White again seeks complications, which is the right attitude for White. With the marked black stone not captured, this strategy is dangerous, but getting the corner and the top left area is big so White should take this risk.]
TR[em]
(;B[cf]
C[Black has a better alternative here. See the variation.];W[de];B[bg];W[bd]
;B[af];W[bc];B[df]
C[This is a better result for White than the last variation.];W[ef];B[eg]
;W[ff]
C[White has to play this way since White is behind, even though it is dangerous for White's group in the middle of the left side.]
;B[fg]
C[Black's play is correct. The threat to White's left side group is obvious.]
;W[gf]
C[White gets a large area at the top left, but Black can make a strong attack against the left side white stones.]
;B[fl]
C[Black 65 is a severe attack.];W[fk]
C[White has to try to save as much as possible here.];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[el]
;B[gn];W[dh];B[ci]
C[This peep with Black 73 is not good for Black. It gives White the chance to make complications. Black should just connect at A with 73, focusing on attacking. Allowing White to cut here helps White a lot by creating a weak black group.]
LB[dg:A];W[dg]
C[The cut with White 74 makes the situation tricky, improving White's chances.]
;B[di];W[ei]
C[The block with White 74 is correct, cutting off the two marked black stones. Black must run these stones out.]
TR[eg:fg];B[qi]
C[Black's playing elsewhere is a big mistake. Who will get sente to return to the upper left is unknown. Black must not give White the huge gain of capturing the two marked black stones. White can harass them, but Black can run them out and prevent White from getting a large gain in this area. These are key stones; Black should not give them up. White should immeidately turn at A. This move is very important for White.]
TR[eg:fg]LB[gg:A];W[cj]
C[White 78 is odd. It doesn't help White's situation. Black should just descend at A and stay connected.]
LB[bi:A];B[bj]LB[bi:A][cg:B]
C[Black 79 is a mistake. It should be at A. White can now play at B and capture the two marked black stones. That would make a huge difference in the overall situation. White is slowly catching up in the game.]
TR[ci:di];W[ej]LB[gg:A]
C[White 80 should be at A. This gives Black a chance to recover.];B[oo]LB[on:A][po:B][np:C]
C[If Black is going to play in this area, it should be at A, putting more pressure on White and taking more profit. Black 81 is too slow. After Black A, if White B, Black C. That would give Black a huge area.]
;W[ri]
C[White 82 is not good; it helps Black. White could have invaded the upper right side. White should must make the normal jump to A, leaving the weakness in Black's position.]
LB[ok:A];B[rh];W[rj];B[qh]
C[Black's shape in the upper right is now complete, a big gain for Black.]
;W[lo]
C[White 86 is an overplay and in the wrong area. White has more potential in the upper left quadrant than Black has here so White should be expanding and defending that area rather than trying to reduce Black here. Moreover, Black may wake up and pull out the two marked black stones, causing a big problem for White. Also as an invasion, White 86 is too deep.]
TR[eg:fg];B[lm]
C[This attack with Black 87 is correct.];W[jm];B[kn];W[in];B[jn];W[nd]
C[White realizes that the strategy of attacking in the lower right is wrong.]
;B[ro]
C[This preliminary attack with Black 93 is necessary if black wants to attack from the outside.]
;W[ok];B[mi];W[il]
C[White 96 is pointless.];B[hk]
C[Black is happy to make this turn with 97. Black is ahead in the game again now.]
;W[lh]
C[White 98 is an overplay, but White is losing so this sort of thing is necessary. Overplays create complications that may yield chances.]
;B[gi]TR[eg:fg]
C[Black doesn't see that the two marked black stones can get out.];W[cg]
;B[bh]
C[Black 101 is necessary (if White captures two stones, Black will recapture one).]
;W[hj]
C[White 102 is good. White cannot afford to try to save the three stones in the upper left.]
;B[bf];W[eh]LB[gg:A]
C[White 104 should be at A. White's left side group is not yet alive. The danger of Black's running these stones out is severe.]
;B[ij]
C[Black 105 is good, attacking the unsettled white group. The fight in the center is becoming complicated.]
;W[ii]
C[White must play aggressively like this.];B[mf]
C[The situation becomes very complicated. 107 is the right way for Black. Black could try to kill the white group on the right side, but that would be uncertain and White might end up both saving that group and making a huge area at the top.]
;W[of]
C[White must fight back with 108. Trying to just defend at the top would be wrong.]
;B[mh]
C[Black correctly aims at staying connected and attacking the various weaknesses in White.]
;W[ng]
C[White must play very aggressively, risking losing much of the area at the top, but White has no choice.]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[oh];W[oi];B[pj]LB[ni:A]
C[Black should turn at A with 115.];W[oj]
C[White has to play this way.];B[pk];W[pl];B[ol]
C[The cut with Black 119 is good.];W[om];B[nl]
C[Black is still winning in the game.];W[mk]TR[mf:mi]
C[White is aiming at the four marked black stones.];B[nk]
C[Black continues to do well. White's group on the right edge is dying.]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[ni];B[li]
C[Black 127 is correct.];W[mm];B[pm];W[ql];B[nm]
C[This has become a do or die situation for White.];W[nn];B[on];W[ml];B[om]
;W[ln]
C[White should not survive this fight.];B[km];W[jj];B[lj]
C[Black is doing well. White has two groups that are dying here.];W[jp];B[ip]
;W[jo];B[lk];W[mn];B[ll]
C[Right. Black must connect. White is struggling mightly but should not survive.]
;W[no];B[mp]
C[Black 147 is a key move.];W[op]
C[White 148 is sente.];B[po];W[oq]LB[pp:A]
C[White 150 threatens to play at A next.];B[pp]LB[pr:A]
C[Descending at A is better for Black 151. This is a mistake.];W[or]LB[lq:A]
C[White 152 at A gives White more chances. The game move is not sente. If Black now plays at A the game will be over. Black would be connected to the black stones to the left. ]
;B[pr]
C[Black is worried about the black corner group and plays at 153. Since Black can push at A and cut for an eye, this is no danger to this group. (It should be noted that Black has been playing in byoyomi of 30 seconds per move for awhile.)]
LB[qm:A];W[lq]
C[White 154 gives White a real chance.];B[nr];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[ns]
;B[lp];W[kq];B[kr];W[ko]
C[White lives here!];B[ld]
C[However, Black can still win because White's group on the upper right side is not yet alive.]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[re];B[qe];W[pi];B[qj];W[rg]
(;B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]
C[Normally, this black attack would work.];W[sf]LB[nf:A][sh:B]
C[The best Black can do now is Black A, capturing seven stones, but White lives with White B. White would win the game this way.]
;B[pe];W[ph]
C[When White plays this atari, Black resigns.])
(;
FG[4353:Ko Fight]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Black's best hope is this ko fight. Black has several ko threats against the large bottom left white group, but White might get out toward the upper edge.]
;B[qg];W[sf];B[pf]))
(;
FG[4353:Better Direction]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Black wants to move into the top area, not the middle left side. Black is already strong on the left side so Black wants to push White in that direction, toward Black's thickness. Black wants to deny White the top left edge where White has more potential. White has to connect at 4 to prevent the double atari at that point. White gets the upper left corner, but Black destroys the area of greater white potential. White's double hane against the corner gives Black this option of changing the direction.]

FG[4353:Damaging White]PM[1]MN[1]TR[eo:go][gp]
C[Note that White cannot capture the four marked black stones.];B[gr];W[fq]
;B[ir];W[hp];B[iq]))
(;
FG[4353:Bigger Problem for White]PM[1]MN[1]
C[White cannot ladder Black 5 and Black can hane at the head of the two white stones below.]
;B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[gp];B[em]))
(;
FG[4353:Better for Black]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Connecting and pushing at Black 3 leaves two outside cutting points in White's shape. This is a good result for Black.]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[em]))
(;
FG[4353:Fighting Back]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Black 5 strengthens Black's group. This way White's corner becomes smaller and Black can aim for the outside. The two marked white stones become poorly placed. But the game move is fine.]
TR[cl:dl];B[dp];W[bp];B[eq];W[ep];B[do];W[dr];B[go]))
(;
FG[4353:Normal Cut]PM[1]MN[1]
C[Peeping and then cutting with 5 after Black hanes at 4 is the normal way for White here. This preserves White's upper left side potential. White could play 9 at A to prevent a black attack at B, but that would leave White's left side group quite weak.]
LB[iq:A][hq:B];W[dn];B[do];W[bm];B[cm];W[cl];B[bn];W[bk];B[am];W[cj]))
(;
FG[4353:Better for White]PM[1]MN[1]
C[White should continue this way. White 5 and 7 are both sente and Black would still not be alive.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cm];B[cr];W[bo];B[cp];W[dr]))
(;
FG[4353:Old Joseki]PM[1]MN[1]
C[This is the proper continuation after Black makes the one space jump if Black wants to play in the corner. It is very important for Black to get the long slide to Black 7 since that creates a base for Black and damages White's potential on the upper left side. White could play 6 at A to prevent 7 although that leaves White's group at the bottom a little uncomfortable---that would be the likely sequence in today's more active style.]
