(All fellow students of my teacher, Yuan Zhou, are my siblings. Students who preceded me are "older" and students who came after me are "younger".)

I met Matt at the 2011 Maryland Open (http://www.usgo.org/news/2011/06/ke-huang-7d-wins-2011-maryland-open/) - I was 10k and he was 11k. I ended up winning my division with a 4-1 record. Matt and I talked after our game and I told him about taking lessons; he became a student himself shortly afterward.

I'm proud of the progress I've made since 2011, but Matt proved in this game that he's made dramatic progress, too. This was a no-komi game where I played white.

Both Matt and I went over this game with Shifu (Yuan Zhou) in our individual lessons. These comments are my attempt to preserve some of the things that came out of my lesson.

Every time there is a statement in quotation marks, I am quoting Shifu.]RE[W+Resign]

(;W[op]WL[2684.9]LB[fq:B][oq:A]C[The idea of this play is to break black's opening, preventing him from playing the Hashimoto opening at A, or the approach at B that can set up the popular mini Chinese opening. (Or the micro-Chinese opening used by Lee Sedol in the first game of his Jubango with Gu Li.)

The cost of it, of course, is that black can simply take the open corner, which is probably the most common response. But the advantage is that it pushes the game into unfamiliar territory, without established patterns to follow. For me, embracing that kind of uncertainty has been a part of getting stronger. I am not always accurate enough in my judgment and reading to win this way, but choosing to embrace this type of game feels like a positive, confident way to play. For me, this not only leads to better results, it represents a way of playing that is fun. And skill follows pleasure.]
;B[oq]BL[2653.7]C[Attaching here might be less good than taking the open corner, but it's joseki, so it's hard to say it's a mistake. Also, if white plays the simplest joseki here white will end in gote, leaving black to take the corner anyway.]

;W[go]WL[2501.1]LB[fe:A][pf:B][dk:C]C[Given the circumstances, this is a good move - it connects up all of white's stones. And it's thick.

We talked a lot about thickness in the lesson. My game has been changing steadily over the past year or two from an emphasis on territory to an emphasis on thickness. "Strong players prefer to play thick." A thick position is one without weaknesses.

But thickness is interesting, because its value can be mysterious. It doesn't produce immediate and obvious territory. I commented to Shifu that though I feel like I've been getting better results as my style has changed, it's often for reasons I can't foresee or predict. So we talked at several places about how and where the value of thickness is evident in this game.

I frequently think of thickness as taking care of my own weaknesses first and not helping my opponent fix his own weaknesses. Whenever you jump out fast into a thin position, you give your opponent the chance to get strong by attacking that weakness - wherever possible, I want to refuse my opponent that gift.]
(;B[bn]BL[2173.2]C[Shifu talked at length about this move and why it's a huge mistake for black.

It felt like a mistake to me, too, but probably the best way I could have explained that is just that black's making himself heavy inside a strong white position.

Shifu said: this is a good example of how thickness can help you, especially against weaker players. Before this move, the opening is good for black - black is better. But it's not easy to see what black should do. Black has good potential, but white has good potential, too, so what's the right way to deal with that? Because of that confusion, it's easy to jump in and start touching things. But as soon as you start touching things, there are consequences.

;W[ao]WL[2490.1]LB[qd:C][fe:A][pf:B][an:2][bn:1]C[This gain essentially gives white back a komi. How? The way to analyze this is to compare the pictures of what black should have gotten without this move to what black will have with it. (This technique is something I find extremely challenging, though it seems like it should be simple.) The variations show the difference, which is eight points. And white got it for free, since the stone at 1 doesn't really help black.]
(;B[qd]BL[2107.2]LB[fe:B][pf:A][dk:C][cl:D]C[This move has obvious value, but it's a slow move that shows a lack of global thinking. A and B are very natural moves in this position.

C is an interesting move that Shifu pointed out to me - the shoulder hit is the fundamental weakness of the low stone at D. It's the most violent way to reduce white's potential, but it can involve some risk if white fights back strongly.]

(;W[fe]WL[2426.3]LB[hi:A]C[I chose to fix the cut at B. But the right answer is that white should fix *neither* of them. White should walk away and close the door to the center with a stone at A. Black is actually already cut off from coming into the center from the top, despite the cuts. And because black is connected and solid on the top, connecting doesn't have any attack value for white.]

;B[cj]BL[1762.6]LB[cj:C][bl:A][bn:B]C[This is a very good move for black.]
(;W[dk]WL[2332.3]LB[ck:A]C[This is a mistake. Not just a mistake, it's a dumb mistake, because it's easy to confirm that this doesn't prevent the connection underneath for black. What's more: I know the right way to prevent the connection because Shifu pointed it out in a previous lesson. White should bump black with A.]
(;B[ck]BL[1711.7]C[But black rewards my mistake with a worse mistake. This is a vulgar move that induces white to fix his shape.]
;W[bl]WL[2291.9]LB[ai:B][an:A]C[This is the key move for white, securing a connection at A and a monkey jump at B that removes black's eye space.]

It's worth noting that in the game I really didn't have an accurate idea of how far behind I was. I felt I was a bit behind, but just a good sequence or two from catching up.

And even though black is ahead, black is in byo-yomi, having used a lot of time during the fights for survival in the center and on the top. That's another way thickness shows its value, Shifu noted. It's easier to play when you're attacking, but the defender has to be very careful, so the defender will use up more time. And thickness also gives you the ability to try more aggressive tactics if necessary later in the game.]

We didn't go over any more of the game in our lesson.

Takeaways:

* Correct judgment in the opening is very important, particularly when both players are playing calmly and waiting for the appropriate moment to begin fighting. Making a move that doesn't work well with your other stones can leave you at an immediate disadvantage. That's one reason some styles emphasize initiating fighting as soon as possible.

* Sometimes my fighting is too lax, too patient. I had an opportunity early to cleanly kill black's stones with a peep and a seal, but I didn't look hard enough for it because I was content to play an obvious but slack move. If I'm going to play for thickness, I need to recognize that when I've got my chance, I have to attack as sharply as possible. "When it's time to shoot, shoot! Don't talk!"

* Never help your opponent! My move at A gave black a key stone. Never assume a forcing move is free. If your opponent is going to win, make sure they win by taking things from you: no presents allowed.

* Study life and death. Life and death isn't just an abstract pursuit: if I had handled the top correctly, it would have been game over. My L&D skills are lagging behind the rest of my game right now.

* Tsumego study matters. Because of my tsumego study, I accurately and easily identified a weakness at C, but I failed to do the same at D. Those kinds of nets are maybe 12k level - continuing to do many relatively quick, easy problems will help me avoid mistakes like this. Because of this, I lost another opportunity to win the game.

* Thickness has value! I made tons of mistakes in this game, but managed to win in the end because playing thick gave me so many opportunities.
