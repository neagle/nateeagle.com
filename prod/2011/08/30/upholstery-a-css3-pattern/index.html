      <h2>Upholstery: a CSS3 Pattern</h2>

  <p>By now, you&#8217;ve seen <a href="leaverou.me/css3patterns/">Lea Verou&#8217;s CSS3 Patterns Gallery</a>. I really dug it when I saw it a few months ago. There are some nice patterns in there (<a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#carbon">carbon</a> &amp; <a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#japanese-cube">Japanese cube</a> are my favorites) and I love generating graphics with code. <span class="caps">CSS</span> gradient syntax made my brain hurt, though, and the first time I tried creating a pattern of my own, I wasn&#8217;t very successful.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>When I used <span class="caps">CSS</span> gradients, I tended to <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/">generate</a> them. That worked okay, but the problem with a tool like that is that it can leave you forever dependent on UI elements and tedious fiddling to get the effect you want. <span class="caps">CSS</span> syntax shouldn&#8217;t be so difficult that it requires a separate tool: the syntax is just a tool itself, after all, intended to make it easy to work with browser code more complicated than anything I&#8217;ll ever write.</p>
<p>So: we&#8217;ve started up a new tradition at <span class="caps">AOL</span> for front-end developers called the <span class="caps">FED</span> Challenge. It&#8217;s a biweekly contest that&#8217;s supposed to encourage developers to try out new techniques and technologies they might not already know about, or to try their hand at something they&#8217;re less familiar with. I decided to make the second <span class="caps">FED</span> challenge creating a CSS3 Pattern ala the examples in Verou&#8217;s gallery, which gave me a chance to finally get past my gradient brain pain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that it didn&#8217;t take very long. Luckily for all of us, Webkit has <a href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/1424/css3-gradients/">changed its gradient syntax</a> to match Mozilla&#8217;s (clearly superior) syntax. And once I got an example in place in jsFiddle and started to play for a sustained amount of time, all the properties seemed to sort themselves out. (Play is, of course, one of the very best ways to internalize something you don&#8217;t know.)</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s my submission:</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 630px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nate/37rxC/embedded/result,css,html,js"></iframe></p>
<p>I was messing around with radial gradients and got the idea that they could be used to create the puffiness of upholstery as well as the shadowed dimples of the buttons. I think it turned out pretty nice.</p>
<p>Check out the <span class="caps">CSS</span> in the tab up above for a highly-formatted, commented version of the <span class="caps">CSS</span>, which I find helpful when trying to look through someone else&#8217;s styles.</p>
<p>If you prefer, however, here is the simplest, streamlined, non-vendor-prefixed version of the <span class="caps">CSS</span>:</p>

<p>I decided to submit the example to Verou after the contest, and she was kind enough to <a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#upholstery">add it to the gallery</a>.</p>
