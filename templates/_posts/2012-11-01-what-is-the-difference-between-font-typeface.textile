title: "What is the difference between font & typeface?"
---
Every so often I'll be out taking a walk and it occurs to me that I still haven't figured out exactly what the difference is between the term _font_ and the term _typeface_. I know they're not the same. I know designers' eyes roll back into their heads when the terms are used interchangeably. Inevitably, I forget about the question in a minute or two and never resolve it.

"WONDER NO MORE, Nate":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Terminology. A font is the "specific member of a type family such as roman, boldface, or italic type". Typeface, on the other hand, is what we usually talk about: a family of related fonts.

"Yo, dude, what font is that?"
"I believe that's roman, actually."
"Roman, huh? Looked kinda like Futura or something to me."
"Ah, you meant to inquire about the typeface."

I look forward to winning friends and influencing people in this manner for years to come.
