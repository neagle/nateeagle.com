It's easy to tell iTerm to use the current directory (@pwd@) for any new tabs, which is what I want to happen 90% of the time I open a new tab. I can't believe I waited this long to figure out how to do this.

Change <strong>Preferences &raquo; Profiles &raquo; General &raquo; Working Directory</strong> to "Reuse previous session's directory".
