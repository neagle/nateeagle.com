(Written after the 2016 US Go Congress in Boston.)

It is fortunate that the satisfaction of go  
is not reliant on victory.  
How horrible and how vain  
if only half of go were glorious  
as if only the rich and comfortable  
and powerful and triumphant  
could call their lives lived.  
It is better that when a go game  
is left soaked in blood  
or tangled in novel intricacies,  
with every twist speaking its own  
furious desire to fight  
or delicate preservation of balance,  
the landscape that it leaves,  
unique and ephemeral,  
affirms the deep worth  
of white and black together.  

It is easiest to imagine peace in death  
if it came during a game of go.  
How effortless to say,  
in standing up at last,  
that this life was lived well.
