title: "Life and Death Problem and Game Record from Yuan Zhou's Monthly Group Go Lesson"
summary: See if you can solve the life and death problem with which we began the day, and watch me battle my nemesis.
---

At our monthly go lessons, [Shifu](http://zhouyuan.com/) has a problem set out on the board in the front of the room when we walk in. We have a lot of time to try to solve it: it's embarrassing how infrequently I manage to do so correctly. Even this month, with an easier-than-usual problem, I failed to get 100% of the correct result. The challenge is always to tell Shifu "what is the best result?", not simply to find a way to achieve a stated outcome. Frequently, the best result is not simply life or death.

Black to Play

(Note: Eidogo's problem interface is not the best. Soon I'll use GoKibitz to do this, and it'll work the way I want, damn it. SOON!)

Nathan Returns
--------------

After several months away, my nemesis Nathan returned, who is now officially 1d AGA! It's some slight consolation for the fact that I've fallen behind him in our head-to-head record. This month, true to form, we had an exciting game. The game record has full commentary by Shifu Yuan Zhou, which comes courtesy of [the AGA](http://usgo.org), who paid for it, and Bill Cobb, who provides the significant work of transcribing and crafting a written record from a complex, in-person back and forth that he records on a video camera. I'm very grateful to Bill for that service; it's no small luxury to have such a high-quality version of a strong player's analysis of my games.

I played black.

It was a heart-breaking result to lose after working so hard to put myself in a winning position, but Nathan's ability to struggle and make chances for himself is no joke. As always, my judgment is a little stronger than my reading accuracy, which makes reading--especially under time pressure--a painful weakness.
