Looking up 'php strftime' again? Skip a step by "adding a shortcut":http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/ye0NLq9ANLc to the first search result for Chrome's omnibox. Then you can use a keyword like "l" to search for items that have obvious reference destinations.

Bonus: Add a similar search engine with the keyword "m" to prefix your search with "mdn" so that the first result for JavaScript questions is from the Mozilla Developer Network instead of W3Schools.
