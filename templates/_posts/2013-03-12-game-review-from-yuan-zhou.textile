I take go lessons from "Yuan Zhou":http://zhouyuan.com. I've played go for just over three years and despite my many character flaws have managed to make some progress. Last week, I decided to take more detailed notes than normal in an attempt to help the instruction sink in more deeply. It was also a chance to try to preserve some of the sayings and general advice that comes up in lessons - it's one of my favorite things about Shifu's style.

I hope you enjoy it!
