      <h2>Easier Post Creation for Jekyll with Bash</h2>

  <p>The biggest reason to use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is, in my opinion, its simplicity and convenience for people who work with files for a living. If changing directories and making files is what you do all day, then writing posts by creating files will just feel like The Way It Should Be. You&#8217;ll love that you don&#8217;t have to log into a web interface to add posts. If you&#8217;d <em>rather</em> log into a web app, I&#8217;m not sure why on earth you&#8217;d use Jekyll: it&#8217;s too minimalistic to offer any huge advantages over the many great CMSs out there today.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of using Jekyll, I found that it was a bit of a chore to think of today&#8217;s date and type it out whenever I wanted to create a post. Since I was adding a second post type called bits to my blog for frequent, short posts it became even more of an issue.</p>
<p>So I created a bash script to make this easier.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about three or four bash scripts in my entire life, so it takes me a bit of time and work to look everything up. In case you&#8217;re in the same boat, I&#8217;m including the script below along with URLs for the references I used along with a few notes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the complete script:</p>
</notextile>

You'll notice I created a layout option that can be passed in using @-l@. I use multiple post layouts on the blog, the most important of which are *post* and *bit*. Bits are very small posts that aren't included in the main list on the homepage or in my Atom feed.

I created two aliases (these should go in your @.bashrc@ file) to simplify creation of posts and bits:

<notextile><p>The script uses post as the default type. On running, the script</p>
<ul>
	<li>prompts me for a title</li>
	<li>uses today&#8217;s date plus a lowercase and dash-separated version of the title for the new post&#8217;s filename</li>
	<li>prepopulates the post with the <span class="caps">YAML</span> I use for posts</li>
	<li>opens the new post in vim</li>
</ul>
<p>So to create this post, I typed:</p>
</notextile>

This created @2011-09-21-easier-post-creation-for-jekyll-with-bash.textile@, added my YAML, and popped it up in vim. Nice.

h3. One last item on my wish list 

I'd really like to find a solution for tab completion when I have a directory full of similarly prefixed files.

<notextile><p>If I have a directory like the one above, I&#8217;d love to be able to type <code>col&lt;TAB&gt;</code> and have it expand to <code>2011-09-11-color-ripples-canvas-toy.textile</code>. In other words, the completion regex would match for a date string and disregard that prefix when matching filenames.</p>
<p>This may well be possible &#8211; even trivial &#8211; for someone smarter than I. I did find a great example of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3238983/writing-a-custom-bash-completion-rule">something similar</a> for vim that&#8217;ll let you add a <code>.completion</code> file to any directory with a static prefix that will allow you to type, say, <code>vim &lt;TAB&gt;</code> and have it expand to <code>vim _myprefix</code>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions for my bash script &#8211; as I said, I&#8217;m a bash n00b, and feedback is welcome.</p>
